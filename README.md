# VW-TDI-Boost-Gauge

This isn't much. I was bored and wanted to make a digital boost gauge for my 2000 Volkswagen TDI 1.9L. A video of it working can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suixj9K7thE

## Parts used:
* Arduino; any 16k unit should work
* HD44780 aka 1602 LCD
* Motorola, Freescale, NXP MPX4250A Pressure Sensor
* A 1999-2004.5 VW TDI

This code is old and crappy. Clean it up if you want, otherwise it "works."
